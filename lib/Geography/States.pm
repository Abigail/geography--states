=head1 NAME

Geography::States - Map states and provinces to their codes, and vica versa.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Geography::States;

 my $obj = Geography::States -> new (COUNTRY [, STRICT]);


=head1 EXAMPLES

 my $canada = Geography::States -> new ('Canada');

 my  $name          =  $canada -> state ('NF');      # Newfoundland.
 my  $code          =  $canada -> state ('Ontario'); # ON.
 my ($code, $name)  =  $canada -> state ('BC');      # BC, British Columbia.
 my  @all_states    =  $canada -> state;             # List code/name pairs.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module lets you map states and provinces to their codes, and codes 
to names of provinces and states.

The C<< Geography::States -> new () >> call takes 1 or 2 arguments. The
first, required, argument is the country we are interested in. Current
supported countries are I<USA>, I<Brazil>, I<Canada>, I<The Netherlands>,
and I<Australia>. If a second non-false argument is given, we use I<strict
mode>. In non-strict mode, we will map territories and alternative codes
as well, while we do not do that in strict mode. For example, if the
country is B<USA>, in non-strict mode, we will map B<GU> to B<Guam>,
while in strict mode, neither B<GU> and B<Guam> will be found.

=head2 The state() method

All queries are done by calling the C<state> method in the object. This method
takes an optional argument. If an argument is given, then in scalar context,
it will return the name of the state if a code of a state is given, and the
code of a state, if the argument of the method is a name of a state. In list
context, both the code and the state will be returned.

If no argument is given, then the C<state> method in list context will return
a list of all code/name pairs for that country. In scalar context, it will
return the number of code/name pairs. Each code/name pair is a 2 element
anonymous array.

Arguments can be given in a case insensitive way; if a name consists of 
multiple parts, the number of spaces does not matter, as long as there is
some whitespace. (That is "NewYork" is wrong, but S<"new    YORK"> is fine.)

=head1 ODDITIES AND OPEN QUESTIONS

I found conflicting abbreviations for the US I<Northern Mariana Islands>,
listed as I<NI> and I<MP>. I picked I<MP> from the USPS site. 

One site listed I<Midway Islands> as having code I<MD>. It is not listed by
the USPS site, and because it conflicts with I<Maryland>, it is not put in
this listing.

The USPS also has so-called I<Military "States">, with non-unique codes.
Those are not listed here.

Canada's I<Quebec> has two codes, the older I<PQ> and the modern I<QC>. Both
I<PQ> and I<QC> will map to I<Quebec>, but I<Quebec> will only map to I<QC>.
With strict mode, I<PQ> will not be listed. Similary, Newfoundland has an
old code I<NF>, and a new code I<NL> (the province is now called
I<Newfoundland and Labrador>).
